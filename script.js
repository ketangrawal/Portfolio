            content: 'Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions. It underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and has applications in various industries.\n\n' +
                     'Blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network, reducing the need for intermediaries and ensuring transparency. Each transaction is recorded in a block, and these blocks are linked together to form a chain. This makes it extremely difficult to alter any information once itâ€™s added to the blockchain.\n\n' +
                     'Key Features:\n' +
                     '- Decentralization: Operates on a peer-to-peer network.\n' +
                     '- Transparency: All transactions are visible to anyone with access.\n' +
                     '- Security: Transactions are secure and tamper-proof.\n' +
                     '- Immutability: Data cannot be altered or deleted once recorded.',

            content: 'Web3 is the next evolution of the internet, focusing on decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi). It leverages blockchain technology to create a more secure, user-centric web.\n\n' +
                     'Core Principles:\n' +
                     '- Decentralization: Reduces the control of large tech companies by distributing power among users.\n' +
                     '- Ownership: Users have ownership and control over their data and digital assets.\n' +
                     '- Interoperability: Enables different blockchain networks and dApps to interact seamlessly.\n' +
                     '- Privacy: Emphasizes user privacy and data protection.\n\n' +
                     'Applications:\n' +
                     '- Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Financial services that operate without traditional intermediaries.\n' +
                     '- Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Unique digital assets representing ownership of specific items.\n' +
                     '- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Organizations run by smart contracts and governed by members.',
